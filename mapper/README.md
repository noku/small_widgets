In this project we will build a map manager.

## Task

Map with pins from sqlite database based on google maps api or skobbler api, there is a simple database server with an array of pixels, each of which has a coordinate, description, type, comments.
need to make a one page web applicaton of the map with the search, based on google maps api or alternative skobbler api (skobbler desirable due to the high limits on the number of views).

The mapper also contains a search box with autocomplete functionality and zoom in on chosen option.
