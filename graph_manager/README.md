In this project we will build a graph manager.

## Task

Necessary to write a script, it is best to adapt a ready one (best anything on d3), outputting the area chart. The graph should be able to: 

- Update regularly with the new data (can be done every second addition of data from the Math.random ()); 
- Being in a specific time frame (eg, 1 minute - if the data is less than one minute, it should be left [empty area](http://puu.sh/9Lb1R/36c5bdded9.png), if more, then go out of scope); 
- Be on page ~ 10-15 copies and not to create friezes at single update data directly in all graphs; 
- Show only the specified region (via thumbs under the graph or the slider) + area should be allocated directly in all graphs (data will be sent simultaneously to the heap graphs, because all the abscissa is common to all graphics); 
- Hide and show different columns in the chart through legend.
